            # 2024-05-29: The ubuntu build started failing with: "Received request to deprovision: The request was cancelled by the remote provider." so we try make without parallellism like with macos

          - os: macos-14
            # 2024-01-05: Sometimes mac fails on github actions when doing builds so we use make without parallellism directly, since we hope that fixes the unknown problem.
